        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Dayshaun St. Louis. I was born on on May 11, 2011. I have a passion for technology
            and have taken several courses to enhance my skills.</p>
        <p>
            I've always been fascinated by technology,
             from the gadgets we use every day to the software that powers them.
              The idea of creating something out of nothing, just lines of code,
               excites me like nothing else. I am intrigued by playing with code and it has lead me to learn a lot.
                trying to understand how it works and what I can do with it, Coding excites me dearly.
                  That's why I'm determined to pursue a career in computer science.
                  I want to dive deep into the world of algorithms and software development,
             pushing the boundaries of what's possible and take my career to success.
